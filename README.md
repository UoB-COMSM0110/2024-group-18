# Game Ideas
A platforming game. You have various classic power-ups, like super jump and ability to destroy platforms. You also have more interesting ones, like the ability to “time travel” where you can save your state and travel back to that state, similar to Ekko in League of Legends.) These power ups come with trade offs (decreasing the amount of time in the level, making enemies stronger etc.) You lose points when your player collides with a platform. 
Challenge 1 - Time Travel Power Up
Challenge 2 - Other Power Ups (super jump etc.)
Challenge 3 - Balancing the power ups

A platforming game. Each time you go through the level your previous incarnations show up - doing exactly what they did previously. They must be avoided. The level is designed to create ‘choke points’ that reward future planning (eg: waiting at certain points to give gaps.) Boss fights might require collaboration between the past and future selves (eg: attacking from both sides at once.) This is somewhat inspired by Tenet, Titanfall 2.
- Load up the game, the objective is to get from the START to the END, simple platformer mechanics
- Upon reaching the END, time is inverted, you must then travel back from the END to the START however your past self who first travelled from START→END is also moving through the level (drawing coming soon), they must be avoided at all costs, as interacting with your past self causes a time paradox (how could you of gotten to where you are if you disrupt the path of your former self?)
- Potential difficulty scaling with how many time inversions you can successfully navigate, i.e. how many past iterations of yourself are all moving through the level at the same time, some will be moving backwards in time (relative to you) and others moving forward (relative to you)
  - Or, arguably cooler, include a boss battle where the boss is impossible to kill alone. Instead, you will need to plan and memorise attacks you make on the first run through the level and combine them with ones you make after time inverts. You will effectively have to fight the boss from both the past and the future at the same time.
      - For example, the boss has a shield which one attack will break, but then requires a follow-up attack to actually damage its HP, and by the time your attack has recharged its shield will have also recharged, forcing you to work alongside your past self
